# Evidence Repository

Store supporting materials such as screenshots, configuration exports, and log samples in this directory. Organize them into subfolders when necessary, and use descriptive filenames so reviewers can quickly identify the contents.

When submitting pull requests, reference each relevant evidence artifact in the PR description. Include the relative path and a short note explaining how the artifact supports the questionnaire responses or implementation details.
