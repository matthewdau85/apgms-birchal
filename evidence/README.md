# Evidence Repository

Place supporting materials in this folder to back up questionnaire responses.

## Screenshots
Store annotated screenshots in the `screenshots/` subdirectory. Include captions in a companion README or within filenames.

## Configuration Exports
Save configuration exports or settings files in `configs/`. Use descriptive filenames that match the referenced control or questionnaire section.

## Log Samples
Add sanitized log snippets or monitoring exports to `logs/`. Ensure sensitive data is redacted.

## Referencing Evidence in PRs
When submitting a pull request, reference evidence by relative path (e.g. `evidence/screenshots/auth-flow.png`). Briefly describe how the artifact supports the control response.
