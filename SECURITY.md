# Security Overview

## Threat Model
- **Assets**: Customer account data, organization configuration, financial transaction records, webhook secrets, and operational telemetry.
- **Adversaries**: External attackers attempting credential stuffing or phishing, malicious insiders seeking privilege escalation, and automated bots probing APIs.
- **Attack Surfaces**: Public APIs, administrative console, webhook endpoints, CI/CD pipelines, third-party integrations, and cloud infrastructure control planes.
- **Assumptions**: Production services run in a hardened VPC with network segmentation, managed secrets, and baseline monitoring; developers follow secure coding standards and undergo regular security training.
- **Mitigations**: Mandatory TLS 1.2+, infrastructure-as-code with security scanning, dependency SCA, regular penetration tests, and automated compliance checks.

## Authentication & MFA Posture
- Primary authentication uses OIDC with short-lived sessions backed by signed JWTs.
- MFA is enforced for all privileged users via WebAuthn hardware keys or TOTP fallback; step-up MFA required for sensitive operations.
- Service-to-service auth relies on mutual TLS and workload identity federation; credentials are rotated automatically.

## RBAC & Organizational Scoping
- Fine-grained RBAC grants least-privilege access, scoped per organization/tenant.
- Roles map to business functions (viewer, operator, admin); privileged actions require dual authorization.
- Access reviews run quarterly with automated revocation of stale accounts.

## Input & Output Validation
- All incoming data validated with centralized schema validators; strict type checking for API payloads.
- Output encoding applied to prevent injection (HTML escaping, parameterized SQL, prepared statements).
- Uploaded files scanned for malware; size and content-type enforced before processing.

## CORS & Rate Limiting
- CORS restricted to approved origins with per-environment allow-lists; preflight caching limited to 5 minutes.
- Global and per-API rate limits enforced via gateway (token bucket) with adaptive throttling based on anomaly detection.
- Automated blocking for repeated policy violations and IP reputation feeds integrated.

## Idempotency & Webhook Anti-Replay
- Idempotency keys required for POST/PUT/PATCH mutations; keys expire after 24 hours and are stored with request hashes.
- Webhook deliveries signed with rotating HMAC secrets; receivers validate signatures and timestamps (5-minute skew window).
- Replay protection enforced with nonce caches and duplicate-delivery detection.

## Audit & Reporting
- Immutable audit logs capture authentication events, privilege changes, configuration edits, and data exports.
- Real-time dashboards provide security posture metrics; monthly reports shared with stakeholders and compliance teams.
- External auditors receive scoped, read-only access to relevant evidence repositories.

## Secrets Management & Key Rotation
- Secrets stored in managed vault (HSM-backed); applications retrieve at runtime via short-lived tokens.
- Automated rotation schedules (90 days default, 24 hours for critical keys) with zero-downtime deployment pipelines.
- Cryptographic keys versioned; old versions revoked and securely destroyed after rollover verification.

## Logging Strategy
- Security events forwarded to SIEM with correlation rules for anomaly detection.
- PII minimization through field-level hashing/tokenization before log ingestion.
- Log retention: 400 days online for security events, 7 years encrypted cold storage for compliance; deletion workflows audited.

## Incident Response
- Follow the incident response runbook: [Incident Response Runbook](docs/runbooks/incident-response.md).
- Dedicated on-call rotation with 24/7 coverage; incidents classified by severity with predefined SLAs.
- Post-incident reviews include root cause analysis, corrective actions, and lessons learned dissemination.

## SBR/AS4 Artifacts
- Secure Build Review (SBR) checklists stored in `compliance/sbr/`; each release gated on completion.
- AS4 artifacts archived in `compliance/as4/` with integrity hashes; access restricted to compliance officers.

## Compliance
- OWASP ASVS Level 2 gate integrated into CI; builds blocked on failed application security controls.
- Operational Security Framework (OSF) questionnaire maintained in `compliance/osf-questionnaire.md` and reviewed quarterly.
- Annual third-party assessments ensure continuous adherence to regulatory obligations.
