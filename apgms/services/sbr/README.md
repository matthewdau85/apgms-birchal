# SBR Service

The Standard Business Reporting (SBR) service packages reconciled financial
summaries for submission to government channels. It receives `sbr.submit`
messages generated by the reconciliation service.

## Responsibilities

- Persist submitted reports along with their reconciliation summaries.
- Emit audit events that capture the reporting period and channel.
- Record telemetry for successful submissions.

## Configuration

| Key       | Description                      | Default |
| --------- | -------------------------------- | ------- |
| `channel` | SBR transmission channel label.  | `test`  |

## Message Flow

1. Receive `sbr.submit` containing the reporting period and reconciliation
   summary.
2. Append the record to the in-memory store.
3. Emit an `audit.log` event indicating successful submission.

## Telemetry

- `sbr.submit.success`

## Testing

The integration test verifies that SBR reports are generated for successful
reconciliations and appear in the orchestrator state snapshot.
