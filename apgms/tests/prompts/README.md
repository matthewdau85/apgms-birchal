# Test generation prompts

This folder contains reusable prompts for generating or reviewing automated tests. When we
capture prompts as versioned artifacts we can iterate on them alongside the codebase and
share effective testing heuristics between teams.

Create one markdown file per topic (for example `automated-testing-ci.md`) and group
sections by test layer so engineers can quickly copy the relevant guidance.
