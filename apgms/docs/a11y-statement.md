# Accessibility Statement

APGMS is committed to providing a digital experience that is accessible to the widest possible audience, regardless of technology or ability. We actively work toward conforming with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2.1 Level AA across the primary customer- facing experiences delivered through the APGMS web application.

## Scope

This commitment covers the authenticated and unauthenticated surfaces of the APGMS marketing and account management flows, including the public home page, eligibility journeys, and the `/bank-lines` experience used to manage banking relationships.

## Ongoing Efforts

- Integrating automated accessibility checks powered by Playwright and axe to detect WCAG 2.1 AA issues in critical user journeys.
- Reviewing new UI components during design and development for keyboard operability, color contrast, and assistive technology support.
- Providing internal training and documentation so engineers, designers, and content authors can incorporate accessibility best practices into their work.

## Feedback

We welcome your feedback on the accessibility of APGMS. If you encounter barriers or have suggestions for improvement, please contact our accessibility team at [accessibility@apgms.example](mailto:accessibility@apgms.example). We aim to respond to feedback within five business days and will work with you to provide the information you need in an accessible format.

## Future Improvements

We are continuing to expand manual and assistive technology testing coverage, enhance semantic structure in complex data views, and improve documentation for third-party integrations so all users can complete key tasks without impediment.
