# Ops runbook

This directory captures operational procedures and supporting playbooks for APGMS. For the prompt-based bootstrap workflow that recreates the monorepo from scratch, refer to [Codex Build Playbook](./codex-build-playbook.md).

For implementation planning, consult the [APGMS Codex Build Programming Tasks](./codex-build-programming-tasks.md) backlog, which breaks the playbook into actionable engineering workstreams.
