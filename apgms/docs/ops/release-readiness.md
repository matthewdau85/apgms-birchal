# Release readiness review — integration/mega-merge

## Summary
- **Date:** 2025-10-20 UTC
- **Branch reviewed:** `integration/mega-merge`
- **Reviewer:** AI automated review
- **Scope:** API gateway service, shared Prisma schema, workspace build/test tooling

## Pillar scores
| Pillar | Score (0-5) | Notes | Delta vs. previous run |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Security | 1 | No authentication or authorization guardrails on the API gateway endpoints; passwords are stored as plain strings with no hashing; no input validation beyond trusting request bodies; no security headers are configured. | No change — issues remain open. |
| Reliability | 1 | Mutating routes accept arbitrary payloads with minimal error handling, no idempotency tokens, and no request validation. Failures will surface as 400s without diagnostics for callers. | No change — still lacks safeguards. |
| Observability | 2 | Fastify logging is enabled and logs routes/environment during start-up, but there is no structured tracing/metrics nor request correlation. | No change — basic logging only. |
| Quality / Testing | 1 | Workspace build and test commands execute but contain only placeholder scripts; no unit, integration, or e2e coverage exists. | No change — automation still missing. |

## Verification matrix
| Area | Status | Evidence | Delta vs. previous run |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Authentication / Authorization | ❌ Missing | Public routes with no auth middleware or guards. | Unchanged — still absent. |
| Credential hashing | ❌ Missing | `User.password` field stored as raw string with no hash. | Unchanged — still absent. |
| Input validation (zod) | ❌ Missing | Zod dependency declared but no schema usage in handlers. | Unchanged — still absent. |
| Security headers | ❌ Missing | No header hardening on Fastify server. | Unchanged — still absent. |
| Idempotency for mutations | ❌ Missing | `POST /bank-lines` blindly inserts records without idempotency checks. | Unchanged — still absent. |
| CI gates / E2E coverage | ⚠️ Placeholder | `pnpm test` / `pnpm -r build` succeed but only run echo scripts; `scripts/e2e-run.ps1` empty. | Unchanged — automation still not implemented. |

## Detailed observations
- **Auth & headers:** The API gateway exposes `/users` and `/bank-lines` routes without any auth middleware or header checks; CORS is wide open with `origin: true`, and there is no helmet-style header configuration. Input payloads are trusted without validation, so malicious data could be persisted.【F:services/api-gateway/src/index.ts†L14-L66】
- **Hashing:** Prisma schema models a `User.password` string with no hashing, so secrets would be stored in plaintext if ever persisted.【F:shared/prisma/schema.prisma†L18-L25】
- **Validation (zod):** The only zod reference is a dependency declaration; handlers cast `req.body` directly instead of parsing schemas, leaving type and range safety unchecked.【F:services/api-gateway/package.json†L1-L18】【F:services/api-gateway/src/index.ts†L42-L60】
- **Idempotency:** `POST /bank-lines` inserts without deduplication or client-provided keys; retrying the request will create multiple records.【F:services/api-gateway/src/index.ts†L42-L61】
- **CI gates / tests:** Workspace build/test commands succeed but execute no assertions. Shared tests contain only comments, and the E2E script stub is empty, so there is no safety net for regressions.【F:shared/test/index.test.ts†L1-L1】【F:scripts/e2e-run.ps1†L1-L1】【F:webapp/package.json†L1-L1】

## Release checklist
| Item | Status | Command / Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Install dependencies | ✅ | `pnpm install`【30fb61†L1-L12】 |
| Build all workspaces | ⚠️ | `pnpm -r build` (succeeds but only runs placeholder build scripts).【d7b80f†L1-L9】 |
| Run automated tests | ⚠️ | `pnpm test` (completes instantly; no assertions executed).【e64b31†L1-L12】 |
| Run E2E suite | ❌ | Not implemented; `scripts/e2e-run.ps1` stub only.【F:scripts/e2e-run.ps1†L1-L1】 |
| Manual verification of API auth/idempotency | ❌ | Not possible — features absent.【F:services/api-gateway/src/index.ts†L23-L66】 |

**Release decision:** **FAIL** — Security, reliability, and automated testing gaps remain unresolved; branch `integration/mega-merge` is not ready for release.
