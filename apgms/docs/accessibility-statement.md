# Accessibility Statement

## Our Commitment

APGMS is committed to delivering a digital experience that is inclusive and usable for everyone. Our goal is to conform to the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) Level AA across our customer and partner experiences.

## Scope

This statement covers the APGMS public marketing site, authenticated customer experiences, and supporting documentation delivered through the APGMS web application. Automated accessibility tests are executed on key user journeys, including the home page and bank lines workflow.

## Testing Approach

We evaluate accessibility on an ongoing basis using automated testing (Playwright with axe-core) and manual review. Automated checks are part of our continuous integration pipeline and run on every change. Failures block deployment until resolved.

## Known Limitations

* Some legacy marketing content may lack complete alternative text or descriptive captions. We are actively auditing and remediating these issues.
* User-generated documents uploaded to the platform may not yet meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards. We provide guidance to authors and continue to improve document templates.
* Third-party widgets embedded in dashboards may not fully support keyboard navigation. We are collaborating with providers to enhance accessibility or identify alternatives.

If you encounter an issue that is not listed above, please let us know so that we can address it promptly.
