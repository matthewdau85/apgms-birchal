# npm Audit Status

## Summary

Running `pnpm audit` currently fails because the registry (https://registry.npmjs.org/-/npm/v1/security/audits) returns HTTP 403. The request requires authentication tokens that are not available in this environment.

## Next steps

1. Configure the required authentication for the npm registry (e.g. by running `pnpm login` or by populating the appropriate token in `.npmrc`).
2. Re-run `pnpm audit` once registry access is restored.
3. Review the generated report and upgrade any vulnerable packages. Document the outcome alongside the remediation steps taken.

Until registry access is restored it is not possible to obtain vulnerability data or automatically apply the recommended upgrades.
