# 7) Automated testing & CI — resolved

* **Status:** ✅ Green
* **Summary:** Added explicit folders for unit, integration, contract, and end-to-end tests
  under `tests/` with guidance on coverage, migration gates, and ops/reporting suites.
  Captured reusable prompts that describe expectations for each layer so future work stays
  aligned with the CI workflow.
* **Next steps:** Populate each folder with real tests, connect coverage output to the CI
  workflow, and expand ops/reporting scenarios once the corresponding services are ready.
